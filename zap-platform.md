# Zap Platform
## What does the Zap platform do?
The Zapp app management platform of Applicaster shrinks the time it takes to launch rich media apps on mobile and TV platforms without sacrificing UI or tech stack requirements. Zapp is built to help your team easily make changes over time as your needs and the market change.

Zapp enables users to configure and build media apps with remote configuration (assets, styles, fonts and localized strings), layout (dynamically composed in Zapp App Builder), and client-side plugins.

You/your team will build and manage apps via the web interface to Zapp, https://zapp.applicaster.com.
